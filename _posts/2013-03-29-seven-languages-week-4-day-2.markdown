<div class="interjection"><p>
(This article is part of a series of posts I am doing about my journey through the exercises of the book <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven Languages In Seven Weeks</a>. The article previous to this one is <a href="/blog/2013/03/28/seven-languages-week-3-day-3/">Week 3 (Prolog) - Day 3</a>. For an overview see the <a href="/projects/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/">Seven Languages project page</a>.)

Topics Covered
---

lots of stuff I already know about and think is cool, I'll have to be careful to
still present that as cool and not give it short shrift just because I already
know about it!

functional programming
    var vs val -- already covered
    collections -- partly focus on these
        lists
        sets
        maps
    Any and Nothing -- maybe explain these, at very least link to one
        and Null and null and Nil
    higher order functions -- it's great that they exist but what can I say about them?
        foreach count map filter foldLeft

maybe rave about how convenient the collections are?
    sortBy was nice to have


Highlights From Exercises
---

Exercises were a lot simpler than the Tic Tac Toe from last time.
I didn't write anything super cool to showcase here
...look at the code again and try to find SOMETHING
multivalue assignment from tuples and maps (and other things?)
