My entry for Ludum Dare #24, with the theme of **Evolution**, is the game
**Conway's Revenge**. [Play it here!](/projects/conways-revenge/flash/)

It is essentially [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) modified to work with mulitple
opposing teams of cellular automata. The rules of reproduction have been tweaked
to make the game more interesting and 'game-like' by preventing deadlock scenarios 
and making sure it's not too hard to get your cells to grow and expand.

It has three game modes planned, two of which are implemented:

 1. **Campaign** - A set of puzzle levels where you
    face off against progressively more difficult enemy formations (unimplemented).
 2. **Battle Royale** - A bloody melee between four different teams of cellular
    automata. The grid is initialized with a random pattern, perfect for
    conflict!
 3. **Sandbox** - A blank slate for you to explore and test your own creations
    with up to four different teams.

[Try it out](/projects/conways-revenge/flash/) and let me know what you think!
