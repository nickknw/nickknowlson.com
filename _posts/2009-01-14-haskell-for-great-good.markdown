(**\*\*Old post alert\*\*** This is an old post I dug up from sometime around college)

So I've been doing bits of the [Learn You A Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) tutorial every now and then, and I just came across this [blog post](http://intoverflow.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/why-haskell-is-beyond-ready-for-prime-time/) on Integer Overflow about why Haskell is "ready for Prime Time".

Now that I've learned a bit about the basics, being told that I am able to search a repository of libraries by _type signature_ is really exciting.  His example really drives it home even for those who don't know any Haskell.

From the other things I've read about Haskell in other articles (mostly that it will introduce you to new paradigms and _blow your mind_) I am now more firmly committed than ever to do some kind of project in Haskell, just to see what it feels like.
