    This script helps highlight things you're looking for when searching for apartments or
    housing on craigslist. 
    
    It will follow each link on the search page and
    scan the individual listing's body page for the keywords you enter. When it
    finds them, it will retrieve them, append them to the end of the individual
    listing, and highlight them green or red for positive or negative.  You can pick
    the terms you are looking for at the top of the page, the script integrates its
    options panel into the search ui for craigslist.
    
    See the screenshots above for an example of what this looks like.

    Features
    ---
    
     * Location, location, location! Finds good and bad locations based on your
       input and highlights the listing in green or red. It highlights the location
       in a deeper green or red for easier scanning.
     * If you enter a maximum (and optionally minimum) value, it will put emphasis
       on the lower prices and fade out the higher ones. For best results enter both
       minimum and maximum values.
     * Finds months and highlights them in blue.
     * Fields where you can enter your own desirable traits, such as 'garden' or
       'skylight'. 
     * Checkboxes for other common desirable things, like fireplaces, balconies and
       dishwashers. These act just like predefined lists of  good and bad traits.
     * Smarter pet searching. If you check 'cats' it will search for a list of
       phrases involving cats and pets. It catches ones that would be filtered out
       by using the normal craigslist cats and dogs checkboxes, and can identify
       many bad matches (e.g. 'no cats')
     * Integrates smoothly into craigslist by emulating its style. Easy to disable.
