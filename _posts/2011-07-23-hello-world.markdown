This site is finally live! I have put a skeleton of content up here for now just so I can get it up, but over the coming months I'll be updating my Project pages with more detail as well as screenshots. I'll also put up the occasional blog post from time to time, and these will lean towards longer, more technical posts.

I meant the logo up above to be temporary, but it is kind of growing on me, so it may stay for a while. 

The css and javascript are a bit clunky at the moment as well, but they work well enough for the moment, and there will be lots of time to optimize the heck out of them in the future.

That's about all for the introductory post, the next one will probably be about something more interesting!
